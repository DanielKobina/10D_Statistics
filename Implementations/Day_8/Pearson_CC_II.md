**Question:** 
The regression line of y on x is 3x + 4y + 8 =0, and the regression line of x on y is 4x + 3y + 7 = 0. 
What is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

*Intermediate Steps:* <br />
y on x: 3x + 4y + 8 = 0, y = -3x/4 - 8/4 <br />
x on y: 4x + 3y + 7 = 0, x = -3y/4 - 7/4 <br />

r = square root of (y on x slope) * (x on y slope) <br />
r = [(-3/4) * (-3/4)] ^ (1/2)
**Answer: +- 3/4**
