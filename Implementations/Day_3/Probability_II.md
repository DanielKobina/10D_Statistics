# Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem

**Question 1:** 
Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

*Thought process:* Determine all possibilities for two children: {B,B}, {B,G}, {G,B}, {G,G} -> 4 possibilities. <br />
There are three elements in our sample that contain one boy as a child. We had 1/3% chance of choosing any of these options.

**Answer: 1/3**

**Question 2:**
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

*Thought process:* Determine probability of picking a specific suit from full deck: 13/52. <br />
With that one card gone, there are 12 cards of the same suit and 51 total cards remaining. Therefore there is a 12/51 chance of the next card also being the same suit.

**Answer: 12/51**

**Question 3:**
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

*Thought process:* Determine probability of choosing a blue marble after the red marble is taken. After the red marble is taken without replacement, there are only 2 red marbles and 4 blue marbles remaining. Therefore there is a 4/6 chance of choosing a blue marble, given that a red marble was taken before hand.

**Answer: 4/6 -> 2/3**
